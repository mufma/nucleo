Analysis of epigenetic data
=

Project done as part of computational biology class. The goal was to develop code for analysis of a biologically relevant problem. In current project we studied influence of methylation patterns on the positioning of nucleosomes. We worked with two cell lines:

1. GM12878
2. K562

These cell lines have both methylation and nucleosomes data, from MeDIP-seq and MNase-seq experiments correspondently.
